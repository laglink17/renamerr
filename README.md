## Warnings

 - Sonarr and Renamerr **must have** the same path for the file. In the compose file, both are registered on /anime.
 - Create the enviroment variables for UID, GID and API. 
 - It's recommend to first create and configure Sonarr, before using this service. The API is needed to access Sonarr files.
